    "- Creating a function called `fahr_to_celsius`\n",
    "- Defining the function to have one input parameter called `temp_fahrenheit`\n",
    "- Creating a variable called `converted_temp` inside the function to which you should assign the conversion result (i.e., the input Fahrenheit temperature converted to Celsius)\n",
    "- Returning the converted value from the function back to the user\n",
    "- Answering some questions about functions at the end of this problem\n",
    "- Adding comments in your code and a docstring that explains how to use your `fahr_to_celsius` function (i.e., you should write the purpose of the function, parameters, and returned values)"
